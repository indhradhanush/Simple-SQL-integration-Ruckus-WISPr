Integration of WISPr portal to achieve SQL query for user authentication

========================

This project is a POC done by me as a Ruckus Systems Engineer to provide functionality of SQL based authentication
In winter 2020, A Chennai based customer has asked us to provide SQL authentication with RADIUS backend. This is possible in our competitor with addon bulky pricey purchase. However it was white elephant to customer as it was a large system with more features but customer would nto use it. Its complex to deploy too.

I proposed a new custom system developed with PHP and HTML which integrates with Ruckus ZoneDirector via WISPr interface.
